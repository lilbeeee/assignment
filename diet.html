    <h1>Salmon Diet</h1>

    <div class="diet-info">
        <h2>Dietary Habits</h2>
        <p>Salmon are classified as carnivores of the middle level, and their diet varies depending on the stage of their life cycle. After reaching the size of fingerlings, salmon fry begin to ingest a wider variety of aquatic invertebrates, including insect larvae, microcrustaceans, and worms. Until then, the majority of their diet consists of zooplanktons. As they mature into juveniles, known as parrs, they become more aggressive predators and aggressively hunt the aquatic insects, tiny crustaceans, tadpoles, and small bait fishes that they encounter. Additionally, it is known that they are capable of breaching the water in order to eat terrestrial insects like grasshoppers and dragonflies, in addition to ingesting fish eggs (including those coming from other salmon). There are a range of marine organisms that salmon consume as adults, including smaller forage fish like lanternfish, herrings, sand lances, mackerels, and barracudina. Salmon act similarly to other pelagic fish of a similar size. Krill, squid, and polychaete worms are among the foods that they consume.</p>
