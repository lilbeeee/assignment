    <h1>Salmon Life Cycle</h1>

    <div class="life-cycle-stage">
        <h2>Egg Stage</h2>
        <p>Salmon eggs are typically laid in freshwater rivers or streams by female salmon in nests called redds. The eggs are fertilized by male salmon, and they hatch after a period of incubation, which varies depending on the species and water temperature.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="life-cycle-stage">
        <h2>Alevin Stage</h2>
        <p>After hatching, salmon emerge as alevins. At this stage, they still have a yolk sac attached to their bodies, which provides them with essential nutrients. Alevins remain hidden in the gravel of the riverbed until they absorb their yolk sac and are ready to swim and feed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="life-cycle-stage">
        <h2>Fry Stage</h2>
        <p>Once the yolk sac is fully absorbed, salmon enter the fry stage. Fry are small, fish-like creatures with functional fins and the ability to swim actively. They primarily feed on aquatic invertebrates and small insects during this stage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="life-cycle-stage">
        <h2>Parr Stage</h2>
        <p>As fry grow, they develop into parr. Parr have more defined markings and coloration, which helps them camouflage in their freshwater environment. They continue to feed on small insects and aquatic organisms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="life-cycle-stage">
        <h2>Smolt Stage</h2>
        <p>Before migrating to the ocean, parr undergo physical changes to become smolt. These changes include adapting to saltwater environments and developing silvery scales. Smolt swim downstream to estuaries and eventually to the open ocean.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="life-cycle-stage">
        <h2>Adult Stage</h2>
        <p>Once in the ocean, smolt grow rapidly into adult salmon. They spend several years in the ocean feeding on various marine organisms, such as fish, squid, and crustaceans. When they reach sexual maturity, adult salmon return to their natal rivers or streams to spawn, completing the life cycle.</p>
