    <h1>Salmon World Count</h1>

    <div class="world-count-info">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Salmon are found in rivers and streams that flow into the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. There are different species of salmon, including Atlantic salmon and various species of Pacific salmon. The world count of salmon varies depending on the species and geographical location. Historically, salmon populations were abundant in many regions, but due to overfishing, habitat destruction, pollution, and other human activities, salmon populations have declined significantly in some areas.</p>

        <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
        <p>Efforts are underway to conserve and restore salmon populations worldwide. These efforts include habitat restoration, fishery management regulations, conservation hatcheries, and public awareness campaigns. Conservation organizations, government agencies, indigenous communities, and other stakeholders collaborate to protect salmon and their habitats for future generations.</p>
