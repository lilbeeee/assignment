            One species of Atlantic salmon and seven species of Pacific salmon make up the salmon family. You may find them in rivers and streams that flow into the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The majority of these species are anadromous, meaning they start their lives in freshwater, move to the open sea, and then come back to breed. Salmons may change their coloration at any point in their lives and have bodies that are smooth and streamlined. Atlantic salmon in freshwater are spotted and brown. As they make their way to the water, they take on a silvery hue. The biggest salmon species, known as Atlantic salmon, may reach a length of just under four feet. When returning to freshwater from the ocean, Pacific salmon go through dramatic changes. Some species become black, while others change their color from silver to deep maroon. The backs of male sockeye salmon get bumps. The seven species of salmon found in the Pacific generally reach a length of 1.5 to 2.5 feet. Many people, both for fun and for profit, fish wild salmon for food. Commercial fish markets now virtually entirely sell farm-raised fish, which nearly wiped off the Atlantic salmon. (To avoid purchasing salmon from unsustainable sources, consider these suggestions.) A lot of salmon species are important to their ecosystems, and that's why they're called keystone species.

        <h1 >Habitat</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: medium; font-weight: bold;">
            As a result of European colonization, the quantity of Atlantic salmon has significantly decreased due to overfishing and the loss of their habitat. Previously, Atlantic salmon were found in abundance along the coast of the North Atlantic, off the coasts of both the United States and Canada. There are just a few rivers in Maine that are home to Atlantic salmon in the United States of America at the present time. Coastal rivers in the northern region of Europe, including Iceland and the northwestern region of Russia, are also home to populations of Atlantic salmon, in addition to the tiny population that is found in North America. In addition to Japan, the western United States and the Pacific Northwest of Canada are home to a number of different species of Pacific salmon.

        <h1 >Diet</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: medium; font-weight: bold;">
            Salmon are classified as carnivores of the middle level, and their diet varies depending on the stage of their life cycle. After reaching the size of fingerlings, salmon fry begin to ingest a wider variety of aquatic invertebrates, including insect larvae, microcrustaceans, and worms. Until then, the majority of their diet consists of zooplanktons. As they mature into juveniles, known as parrs, they become more aggressive predators and aggressively hunt the aquatic insects, tiny crustaceans, tadpoles, and small bait fishes that they encounter. Additionally, it is known that they are capable of breaching the water in order to eat terrestrial insects like grasshoppers and dragonflies, in addition to ingesting fish eggs (including those coming from other salmon). There are a range of marine organisms that salmon consume as adults, including smaller forage fish like lanternfish, herrings, sand lances, mackerels, and barracudina. Salmon act similarly to other pelagic fish of a similar size. Krill, squid, and polychaete worms are among the foods that they consume.
